# T1G3 - Gestão de Frota Automóvel / Automotive Fleet Management

## Description
In a company with a large fleet of cars, it is difficult to manage the daily use of the vehicles, control the costs associated with each vehicle, register curative maintenance and create periodic maintenance planning. This project aims to integrate cost control (such as budget comparison) in a single platform, history of services performed, maintenance and inspection alerts, management and assignment of vehicles to employees for occasional trips, possibility of integration with an OBD2 interface allowing GPS location, sending, management and error monitoring of each vehicle. The platform should be able to send notifications for emails and generate internal alerts for various types of notices.
